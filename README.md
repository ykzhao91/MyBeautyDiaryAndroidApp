# MyBeautyDiaryAndroidApp
The is an Android app that I designed and coded

Time Duration: 2015/01 - 2015/04

The idea of this app all comes from a change in my life, which is my first job offer letter. Things become much more different for me than before. The pressure comes not only from the 8am-5pm work load, but also the daily look and fresh mind.
Then I was thinking why there is not an app that integrates the information I need, so that I can simply use my mobile to browsing the tutorials and read whenever I want.

As for the app, there should be several functions as listed below:
• Get inspiration for new makeup looks and hairstyle
• Learn how to create a look with step-by-step video tutorials
• Discover the latest beauty tips, tricks, and trends
• Find ratings and introduction for all kinds of beauty products
In this way, the app can become a daily look helper for the user. You can browse the new beauty related blogs whenever you have time. Your inspiration would come right away for a totally refreshing new look!
